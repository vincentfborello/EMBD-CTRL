//** ENGR-2350 Template Project 
//** NAME: XXXX
//** RIN: XXXX
//** TEMPLATE VERSION: v.92 (2025-09-25)
//** This is the base project for several activities and labs throughout
//** the course.  The outline provided below isn't necessarily *required*
//** by a C program; however, this format is required within ENGR-2350
//** to ease debugging/grading by the staff.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// We'll always add this include statement. This basically takes the
// code contained within the "engr_2350_msp432.h" file and adds it here.
#include "engr2350_mspm0.h"

// Add function prototypes here as needed.


// Add global variables here as needed.


int main() {    //// Main Function ////
  
    // Add local variables here as needed.

    // We always call the sysInit function first to set up the 
    // microcontroller for how we are going to use it.
    sysInit();

    // Place initialization code (or run-once) code here
    
    while(1){  
        // Place code that runs continuously in here

    }   
}    //// End Main Function ////  

// Add function declarations here as needed

// Add interrupt functions last so they are easy to find
